# AI-Game-Connect-4
## Final Project Artificial Intelligent Course

## Description
Connect 4 is a two-player strategy game where the objective is to be the first player to connect four of their own colored discs in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on a grid. The game is played by dropping discs into one of the seven columns, which causes them to stack up from the bottom. Players take turns placing their discs, and the game continues until one player successfully connects four discs or the entire grid is filled, resulting in a draw. It is a popular and engaging game that requires strategic thinking and planning to outmaneuver your opponent and achieve victory. <br> <br>
This game is built based on artificial intelligence, where the development of the game utilizes the Python library specifically designed for gaming called Pygame. The game can be played in two modes: VS AI and VS Friend. Players can choose from three difficulty levels: easy, normal, and hard.
